Colorado Mountain Towns - Grand Junction

山城秋色 - Grand Junction

--------

Grand Junction is located at the confluence of the Colorado River and Gunnison River. In addition to the big rivers, with the great hiking trails all around and the energetic downtown, it is the best choice as the last stop of our trip to Colorado.

Grand Junction位于科罗拉多河与Gunnison河的交汇处，除了大川大河，周围有很好的徒步路线，市中心也是人气旺盛，以此作为我们这次科罗拉多赏秋之旅的最后一站，是最好的选择。

<p>In the morning, my wife went shopping in the downtown, and I went hiking in Monument Canyon to the northwest of the city. The name of this place first reminds people of Monument Valley in Utah, famous for its towering rock formations. Monument Canyon also has similar landscapes, but on a smaller scale. It takes about 20 minutes to drive from Grand Junction, which is enough to produce a weather difference. The weather forecast said it would rain in the city, but the rain would not pass through the park. It turned out that the weather forecast was reliable.

<p>After leaving the starting point for the trail, after 600 feet, the path splits in two directions to the north and south. I followed the counterclockwise loop. This part is called Wedding Canyon Trail. The path is not well maintained and not well marked. There is a section where I walked to a low cliff, but this section is gentle and easy to walk down from the cliff.

<p>Starting from the left turn from here, the terrain gradually steepened, extending into the depths of Wedding Canyon. Because it was on a hillside, the road was harder to find and often I had to walk back, compared to the map before moving forward. The opposite side of the valley can already see towering rocks.

<p>The end of the Wedding Canyon Trail is at the foot of Independence Monument. John Ott was the first non-native to discover this valley. For many years starting in 1906, he is almost the only person that built and maintained the trails here. On Independence Day in 1911, he put an American flag on the top of this rock, which may be the origin of the name Independence Monument.

<p>It was much easier to walk back from Monument Canyon Trail, all downhill, and the trail was also very smooth. The trail is about 5-mile long. It took me about two and a half hours to complete, quite an easy trail with beautiful scenary.

<p>While I was hiking, my wife was doing some shopping in the downtown, and it rained heavily for a while. When I came back and looked at the photos on our phones, I could tell exactly where I was when my wife was in a certain store, as if we shared our experiences but in different time and space together, which was quite interesting. We had a walk again around the downtown area, going to a nice coffee shop and a musical instrument store. The streets on both sides of the downtown have many sculptures, some realistic, recording historical characters and events, some abstract, and some very funny and interesting, worth a visit.

<p>We had lunch at a Thai restaurant outside the city center, took a break in the afternoon, and visited Monument Canyon again in the evening. This time, we drove up to the top of the canyon, and the road twisted along the edge of the cliff. When we went up the mountain, the cliff drops hundreds of feets on one side. It was really a bit nervous.

<p>Below the canyon is the place where I walked this morning. It looks somewhat like the Grand Canyon from above. The sky was already dark, and we saw a photographer taking pictures by the cliff. He put two identical cameras at the each end of a frame separated by a certain distance, and used a homemade synchronization device to trigger the shutters of the two cameras at the same time. The two photos taken this way can produce a 3D effect after post-processing.

<p>In the evening, we returned to the city and had dinner at a restaurant called TacoParty. The restaurant specializes in Tacos, with non-traditional ingredients and creative ideas. It is very tasty.

<p>The second morning, I first ran along the river for a while. Returned to the hotel and we went to Las Colonias Park on the Colorado River. You can tell from the name of the city, Grand Junction is located at the confluence of two rivers. The Colorado River rushes out of the Rocky Mountains, and the Gunnison River flows northward here. However, the "Grand" here does not mean a big river. Before 1921, when people talked about the Colorado River, they referred to the downstream starting from the Canyonland National Park in Utah. The upstream of the river was called Grand River, and it is only called the Colorado River after merging with the Green River. Until now, many places in Colorado still have "Grand" in their names. It was not until 1921 that the name of the Colorado River was extended to the upstream, and then the Colorado River truly originated in Colorado.

<p>It takes about an hour to drive from Grand Junction to Montrose. We quickly had lunch at the same Japanese restaurant in Montrose. When planning the itinerary, it took me sometime to decide which city would be our last stop in Colorado. Grand Junction is still more energetic and popular than the other.

<p>The trip to Colorado is our first long trip after the epidemic. Although there was another outbreak at the end of the year, mentally we have crossed the barrier of uncertainty and fear. Finally We can travel again.

<p>早上和领导分头行动，领导在城里逛街，我去城西北方向的Monument Canyon爬山。这个名字首先让人想到的是位于犹他州的Monument Valley，以孤峰巨石闻名。Monument Canyon也有类似的景观，规模数量上都小一些。从Grand Junction出发开车要20分钟左右，这个距离足够产生天气的差异。天气预报说城里会下雨，但是降水不会经过公园。事实证明天气预报还是靠谱的。

<p>从徒步的起点出发不到200米，小路就向南北两侧分叉。我走的是逆时针方向的环线。这一段叫做Wedding Canyon Trail，小路没有什么维护，也没什么标记，有一段还走到一处低矮的山崖上，不过开始的一公里多道路平缓，很容易就从山崖上走下来。

<p>从小路左转的地方开始，地势逐渐变陡，向Wedding Canyon的深处延伸。因为是在山坡上，路更不好找，常常要退回来、对照GPS和地图再向前行。山谷的对面已经能看到一座座耸立的巨石。

<p>Wedding Canyon Trail的尽头就在“独立纪念碑”（Independence Monument）的脚下。除了当地的原住印第安人以外，John Ott是发现开发这片山谷的第一人。从1906年开始的很多年间，他几乎是独自一人在这里开凿修整山路。1911年的美国独立日，他把一面美国国旗插到这座巨石的山顶，这也许就是“独立纪念碑”名称的由来。

<p>从Monument Canyon Trail走回来要简单的多，一路下坡，山路也很平整。我化了大约两个半小时走完一圈，实际上还不到八公里，除了上坡的一段，算是轻松完成。

<p>我在爬山的时候，领导在城里逛街，有一阵雨还下得很大。回来看手机照片，能够对得上我走到某个地方的时候，领导在哪个店里，仿佛有一种时空交错的共同体验，也挺很有意思。我回到城里，领导又陪我逛了一圈，去了不错的咖啡店和乐器店。Grand Junction市中心的街道两旁有很多风格各异的雕塑，有的写实，记录人物、历史，有的抽象，有的又很搞笑风趣，值得一游。

<p>中午在一家市区外的泰国餐馆吃了午饭，下午稍事休息，傍晚再访Monument Canyon。这一次是开车上到峡谷的顶部，公路沿着山崖的边缘蜿蜒向前。上山的时候，一侧就是悬崖，还真有些紧张，要小心而行。

<p>峡谷下面就是今天早晨走过的地方，从上面看和大峡谷有一两分相似。天色已经擦黑，我们在山崖边看到一个在拍照的摄友。他把两台同样的相机固定在相隔一定距离的架子两端，用自制的同步设备同时触发两台相机的快门。这样拍出的两张照片经过后期处理可以产生3D的效果，

<p>晚上回到城里，我们在一家叫TacoParty的餐馆吃了晚饭。餐馆主打Taco，不走传统的路子，有不少新式的搭配，也很可口。

<p>第二天早晨先沿着河边跑了一圈步。回到旅馆，又和领导一起来到位于科罗拉多河边的Las Colonias Park。从城市的名字就可以看出，Grand Junction位于两条大河的交汇处。科罗拉多河从落基山脉奔涌而出，Gunnison河自南而北在此汇入。不过这里的“Grand"并不是意指大河，1921年前，人们说起科罗拉多河，指的还是从Utah州Canyonland国家公园起的部分。河的上游叫做Grand River，与Green River交汇后才被称为科罗拉多河。至今为止，科州还有很多地名带有“Grand”，皆是源自于此。直到1921年，科罗拉多河的名字才被延申至上游，科罗拉多河也才真正从科罗拉多州起源。

<p>从Grand Junction开车到Montrose只要大约一个小时。为了方便，我们在Montrose城区的同一家日本餐馆很快吃了午饭。计划行程的时候还有些纠结，在科罗拉多州的最后之一站应该住在那个城市。相比起来Grand Junction还是更有活力和人气。

<p>科罗拉多州的赏秋之旅是我们疫情后的第一次长途旅行，虽然年底的时候还有一次病毒变种的爆发，但是在心理上已经跨过那种未知、恐惧的障碍。我们终于又可以恢复旅行了。
