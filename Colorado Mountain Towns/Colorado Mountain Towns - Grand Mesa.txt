Colorado Mountain Towns - Grand Mesa

山城秋色 - 大平顶山

--------

Grand Mesa is the largest flat-topped mountain in the world, and a great place to see the fall colors and experience all four seasons in one day.

山下还是暑气未消的夏末，山中央已是满满的秋意，而山顶只有阴云下的松林和湖泊。Grand Mesa是世界上面积最大的平顶山，也是欣赏秋色、体会一日四季的好地方。

<p>I had pondered about where to go after Telluride and finally decided to drive to Grand Junction, took a detour through the Grand Mesa. This will cover most of western Colorado.

<p>We had planed to walk along the mountain rim in the early morning, but the weather was so gloomy that it was going to rain. It was only a little drizzling in the beginning, after a short walk, the rain got heavier. We had to run back to the hotel where I had lunch the day before.

<p>The rain didn't look like it was going to stop, so we had to take the gondola to the small plaza on the other side of the resort and buy some snacks for the trip.

<p>After leaving the San Miguel Valley, it started clearing up and by the time we reached Ridgway, the sun was shining brightly. As the gateway to the San Juan Mountains, several railroads connecting the mining towns of Ouray and Telluride intersect here. Most of these railroads were abandoned in the 1950s and 1960s, and now Ridgway's most famous landmark is the True Grit restaurant. The 1969 western film was filmed near Ridgway and Ouray, and won John Wayne an Oscar for best actor.

<p>Black Canyon of the Gunnison (Black Canyon of the Gunnison) is a national park 12 miles west of Montrose. We decided to visit the park first and then go back to Montrose city for lunch.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Black Canyon is a canyon formed by the erosion of the Gunnison River. Compared to the Grand Canyon, Black Canyon is far less dramatic and colorful, but the Gunnison River has a much faster drop per mile than the Colorado River in this section of the valley. As a result, the mountains on both sides of the Black Canyon are much steeper, and even during the day time, the rock walls are mostly in the shadows where the sun does not shine, giving them the dark color, so it is the canyon named.

<p>From the south entrance of the national park, there is only one road that runs along the south rim of the canyon. At each viewpoint, visitors can get out of the car and walk the trail to the cliff. The elevation here is over 8,000 feets. The cliffs are mostly gray and black but vegetation at the top showed the fall colors. The canyon is quite spectacular, with some places offering a panoramic view of the Gunnison River flowing out of the valley and into the plains, but after seeing more of it, it's pretty much the same. We drove all the way to High Point at the end of the road, and then back the way we came.

<p>We had a quick lunch at a Japanese restaurant in Montrose, you shouldn't have much hope for Japanese food in a place like this.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we continued north on Highway 50, we could already see the mountains ahead of us, with their flat tops stretching eastward. From Delta, I turned right and followed the navigation on a winding route that eventually took us to Highway 65 to the Grand Mesa.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>About halfway to the Grand Mesa there is a small town called Cedaredge. On the side of the road is the Pioneer Town Museum, which commemorates the pioneers of the westward movement in the U.S. history. We arrived at 5 p.m. and the museum was already closed. We could only look outside at the three tall wooden barns and take a short break.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Soon after we left Cedaredge, the road rose with the mountain and the leaves gradually changed color from green to yellow. The top of the Grand Mesa is a layer of basalt nearly 300 feets thick, forming a vast flat top because it is harder and more resistant to erosions than the surrounding sediments. It is the largest flat-topped mountain in the world.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The summit is about 10,000 feets above sea level. Because of the high precipitation, more than 300 lakes of various sizes are formed. Near the top of the mountain there are still rich autumn colors, but at the top broad-leaved forest can no longer grow, only a pine forest exists. By the time we reached the summit it was 6pm. The ground around the lake was muddy, so we couldn't go any deeper. There was no one around. The gloomy feeling was in stark contrast to the intense autumn colors ten minutes before.

<p>It was a wild downhill ride after that. I remember a few years ago coming out of Aspen towards the other direction of I70, the mountains on both sides were treacherous, and the highway through the Rocky Mountains was an engineering marvel back the time when it was built.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our hotel was located right next to the downtown street, simple, spacious and clean. When we walked out for dinner, it was already after 8pm. Many restaurants were ready to close. We had dinner at a Mexican restaurant called Las Marias. From the decoration to the food, it has the feel of a Mexican family restaurant. The taste is good and it's very affordable. The owner is an old lady, I asked her for Maxican spicy sauce, and she confirmed with me that it's what I wanted. I got two plates of it. It was quite spicy indeed!

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was almost 10 o'clock when I came out of the restaurant. The streets of downtown Grand Junction are clean and the stores look newly built, so there is no feeling of insecurity. There are many statues on the roadside, very walkable city!

<p>出发前我为离开Telluride以后还去哪里纠缠了好久，最终决定开车去Grand Junction，绕道大平顶山（Grand Mesa），算是覆盖了科罗拉多州西部大部分的地方。
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>早晨起来本打算沿着山边再走一圈，天气却是阴沉的要下雨。本来在蒙蒙细雨中走一走其实挺好，不过走了不远，雨渐渐大了起来，身上快被淋透，只好跑回前一天吃午饭的酒店。

<p>看雨势不像要停下来的样子，我们只得做缆车到度假村另一侧的小广场，买了些路上的零食。

<p>离开San Miguel河谷，天气就变的晴朗起来，到达Ridgway的时候已是艳阳高照。作为San Juan山脉的门户，连接Ouray和Telluride这些采矿重镇的多条铁路交汇于此。这些铁路大多在上世纪五、六十年代被放弃，现在Ridgway最有名的地标是True Grit餐馆。这部1969年的西部电影就在Ridgway和Ouray附近取景拍摄，也为约翰·韦恩这位西部片大明星赢得了一座最佳男演员的奥斯卡奖杯。

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>甘尼森黑峡谷(Black Canyon of the Gunnison)，听着是不是有哈利波特般的魔幻感觉？这其实是Montrose城西约半个小时车程的一个国家公园。从Ridgway到Montrose，我们决定先去公园转一圈，再回Montrose城里吃午饭。
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Black Canyon是由甘尼森河（Gunnison River）侵蚀而成的峡谷。和科罗拉多大峡谷相比，无论是山势的波澜壮阔还是色彩的丰富多变，黑峡谷都远远不及，但是甘尼森河在这一段不足20公里的山谷间每公里的落差却远超过造就大峡谷的科罗拉多河。因此黑峡谷两侧的山势更为陡峭，即使是白天，岩壁也多处于阳光照不到的阴影处，颜色黝黑，这也是黑峡谷名字的由来。

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>从国家公园的南门入园，只有一条公路沿着峡谷的南缘而行。每到一个观景点，游人可以下车，沿小路走到崖边。这里的海拔有两千多米，虽然山崖色彩单调，但是山顶的植被还是有些秋色。峡谷也是颇为壮观的，有些地方能远眺甘尼森河流出山谷、汇入平原之景。不过看的多了，也是大同小异。我们一路开的公路尽头的High Point，又原路返回。

<p>我们很快的在Montrose的一家日本餐馆吃了午饭，对这样地方的日餐不用抱太大的希望。
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>沿着50号公路继续北行，远远的已经能够看到前方的山峦，平平的山顶一直向东延伸。从Delta右转，跟着导航走了一条曲曲折折的路线，最终开上去大平顶山的65号公路。
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>在到大平顶山大约半程的地方有一座叫Cedaredge的小城，路边有一个纪念当年美国西进运动先驱的博物馆，Pioneer Town Museum。我们到的时候是下午五点，博物馆已经关门。我们只能在外面看看三个高高的木制谷仓，稍事休息。

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>离开Cedaredge不久，道路随山势逐渐上升，树叶的颜色也逐渐由绿转黄。大平顶山的顶部是一层近100米厚的玄武岩层，因为比周围的沉积岩更坚硬耐腐蚀，所以形成一个广阔的平顶。我没想到的是，这里居然是世界上面积最大的平顶山。

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>山顶的海拔约3000米，因为降水多，所以形成大大小小三百多个湖泊。接近山顶的地方还有浓郁的秋色，到了山顶阔叶林已经不能生长，只有一片片的松树林。我们到达山顶的时候已经是下午六点，天色阴郁。湖畔的地面泥泞，不能再往深处走，周围一个人也没有，满目萧索的感觉，与十分钟前浓烈的秋色对比强烈。

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>过了山顶就是大下坡，汇入70号州际公路后更是一路狂奔。我还记得几年前从Aspen出来走的是70号路的另一个方向，两侧的群山险峻，穿越落基山脉的70路当年也是工程建设的奇迹。
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>很快就到了Grand Junction。我们的旅馆就在市中心大街旁边，简单宽敞整洁。出来吃饭的时候已经是八点多，很多餐馆都已经准备打烊。我们在一家叫Las Marias的墨西哥餐馆吃了晚饭。从装饰到菜品都有墨西哥家庭馆子的感觉，味道不错也很实惠。老板是一位老太太，我向她要墨西哥辣子，她特地跟我确定才乘了两碟出来。果然够辣！

<p>从餐馆出来已经快10点，Grand Junction市中心的街道干净，店面看着也很新，没有不安全的感觉。路边有很多各式各样的雕像，很适合逛街的样子。
