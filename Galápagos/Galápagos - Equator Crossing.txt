Galápagos - Equator Crossing

加拉帕戈斯群岛 - 穿越赤道





<b>Punta Vicente Roca, Isabela Island.</b> Punta Vicente Roca is located at the mouth of the seahorse-shaped Isabela Island, with intense volcanic activity. From here, northward, we cross the equator and will return to the central waters of the archipelago.


<b>Punta Vicente Roca位于伊莎贝拉岛</b>海马形状的嘴部，火山活动剧烈。从这里向北，我们穿越赤道，将会回到加拉帕戈斯群岛的中部海域。

<p>During lunch time, the yacht returned from Fernandina Island to Isabela Island. The yacht docked at Punta Vicente Roca, which is located at the mouth of seahorse-shaped Isabela Island. The western side of the Ecuadorian volcano collapsed into the sea, leaving only half of the mountain attached to the island. Ecuadorian volcano is the smallest among the six volcanoes on Isabela Island.</p>

<p>Punta Vicente Roca is a good place for snorkeling because it is located near the equator, where wildlife converge because several ocean currents meet here. After lunch, we first dived in the bay near the crater, probably because there are more plankton, the water here is not very clear. There are many sea turtles, almost within reach.</p>

<p>When it comes to the diversity and uniqueness of the flora and fauna of the Galápagos Islands, it is important to talk about the geographical location and geography of the islands. Like Hawaii and Tahiti, the Galápagos Islands are volcanic islands. Instead of being located where the earth's plates meet, these islands are in the central part of the plates. The popular explanation for the high volcanic activity is attributed to the hotspots in the Earth's mantle, and the Galápagos Islands are on top of such a hotspot. The release of energy from the hotspot causes the formation of volcanoes, and the eruptions form islands that move eastward with the plate they are on. Therefore, the eastern islands of the Galapagos Islands are more ancient, and the western-most Fernandina Island is the youngest, only about seven hundred thousand years old.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The newly formed islands had intense volcanic activity, the soil was infertile. The surface was mostly covered with volcanic rocks and it was difficult for plants to survive. As the altitude of volcano increased, precipitation increased; the accumulation of plants and animals also slowly improved the soil, and forests gradually formed in the higher elevations of the mountains. Santa Cruz Island is representative of this type of island in the intermediate stage. The eastward shift of the plate took the island out of the hotspot and volcanic activity stopped. Because of self-weight and weathering, the volcanoes gradually collapsed and slowly sank into the sea. This is the fate of all the islands of the Galápagos Islands, and the whole process took about two to three million years.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Volcanic remains as far back as 7 or 8 million years have also been found underwater further southeast in the Galápagos Islands, and the emergence of islands in this region may be as far back as tens of millions of years. The volcanic islands were separated by seawater, allowing species to evolve independently; and the islands were not so far apart that a small number of plants and animals were able to migrate to the emerging islands and begin a new evolutionary process. Those islands that sank to the bottom of the sea did not stop evolving; they provided nutrients and habitat for marine life.</p>

<p>After the snorkeling, we took a short break and reboarded the zodiac. The zodiac departed from the southern end of the crater and slowly floated south along the rocky shore wall. There were several pairs of Nazca Boobies, some with their young, on the rocks jutting out from the shore. It's just a pity that the wind and waves were too strong here and the zodiac undulates so much that it's hard to get a clear picture.</p>

<p>There is a large cavern in the small bay on the south side of the crater, probably formed by the flow of magma, similar to a lava tunnel.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Such top-to-bottom cracks can often be seen in the rock walls, which are vertical faults between rocks. The volcanic activity caused the fault to split and the magma to pour in, creating such a geological structure. The intensity of volcanic activity in this area is evident.</p>

<p>Leaving Punta Vicente Roca, we're heading back to the central islands of the archipelago tonight, circling around Seahorse Head of Isabela Island. The boat would cross the equator as it headed north. It is a tradition for ships on long voyages to hold a ceremony for the crew of the ship crossing the equator for the first time. Like a Halloween celebration, the crew dresses up in fancy costumes, usually with someone dressed as Neptune, and there are often crazy antics during these ceremonies.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The location of the Galápagos Islands also contributes to its diversity of species. The Cromwell Current, also known as the Equatorial Current, is an ocean current that runs west to east across the Pacific Ocean at about 100 meters below the surface. Cold currents from the Panama Basin in North America and Peru in South America meet the Cromwell Current at the Galapagos Islands, which are located on the equator. The cold currents rise to the surface when they reach the islands, bringing large numbers of microorganisms to the surface and nourishing the life in the waters around the islands. In some years, for unknown reasons, these cold currents weaken, causing the temperature of the sea surface to rise, and an El Niño phenomenon is formed.</p>

<p>Traditions need to be observed, but of course our celebration was much more civilized. Everyone on board gathered in the cockpit of the boat, Marco poured a glass of champagne for everyone, and we gathered around the GPS device, waiting for the moment of crossing. When the number on the panel jumped to zero, everyone broke out in cheers. After the celebration, the captain also let the young boys on board to drive the boat himself.</p>

<p>中午吃饭的时间，游艇从费尔南迪纳岛回到伊莎贝拉岛。游艇停靠的地点是Punta Vicente Roca，这里位于伊莎贝拉岛海马形状的嘴部。厄瓜多尔火山的西边坍塌到海中，只剩下大半山体与岛相连，是伊莎贝拉岛六座火山中最小的一座。</p>

<p>Punta Vicente Roca附近是潜浮的好地方，因为位于赤道附近，多股洋流在此交汇，也是野生动物多汇聚与此。吃过午饭，我们先是在火山口附近的海湾潜浮，可能因为浮游生物比较多，这里的海水不是很清澈，但是海龟很多，几乎触手可及。</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>说到加拉帕戈斯群岛动植物种类的多样和独特，就不得不提到群岛的地理位置和地理环境。和夏威夷、大溪地一样，加拉帕戈斯群岛也是火山岛。这些岛屿的位置不是在地球板块的交接处，而是处于板块的中央部位。之所以火山活动频繁，比较流行的解释将其归结于地球地幔中的热点（hotspot），而加拉帕戈斯群岛就处于这样一个热点之上。热点的能量释放造成火山的不断形成，火山喷发形成的岛屿又随着所在的板块向东移动。所以加拉帕戈斯群岛东边的岛屿更加古老，最西边的费尔南迪纳岛最为年轻，大约只有七十万年左右。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>新形成的岛屿火山活动剧烈，土壤贫瘠，植物难以生存，地表大多被火山岩覆盖。随着海拔的升高，降水增多；动植物的积累也慢慢改善了土壤，森林逐渐在海拔比较高的山地形成。圣克鲁兹岛正是这类中期岛屿的代表。板块的东移将岛屿带出热点区域，火山运动停止下来。因为自重和风化，火山逐渐塌陷、被海水侵蚀，慢慢沉入海中。这是加拉帕戈斯群岛所有岛屿的最终命运，整个过程大约要经历两三百万年。</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>在加拉帕戈斯群岛更东南面的水下还发现了远至七八百万年的火山遗迹，而这个地区出现岛屿的历史可能远达数千万年之久。间隙出现的火山岛被海水分隔开，物种得以独立的进化；而岛屿之间的距离又不是太远，少量的动植物能够迁徙到新出现的火山岛，开始新的演化过程。那些沉入海底的岛屿并没有停止演化，它们为海洋生物提供了养分和栖息的空间。</p>

<p>潜浮结束，我们稍事休息，又重上登陆艇。登陆艇从火山口的南端出发，沿着岸边的岩壁，慢慢向南漂浮。岸边突出的岩石上，有几对<a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%A9%99%E5%98%B4%E8%93%9D%E8%84%B8%E9%B2%A3%E9%B8%9F/13981970" data-type="URL" data-id="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%A9%99%E5%98%B4%E8%93%9D%E8%84%B8%E9%B2%A3%E9%B8%9F/13981970">橙嘴蓝脸鲣鸟</a>，有的还带着它们的幼鸟。只可惜这里风浪比较大，登陆艇起伏的很厉害，照片很难拍清楚。</p>

<p>岩壁上常常可以看到这样从上至下的裂痕，这是岩石间垂直的断层。火山活动造成断层分裂，岩浆灌入，就形成这样的地质构造。这一地带火山活动之剧烈可见一斑。</p>

<p>离开Punta Vicente Roca，我们今晚要绕过伊莎贝拉岛的海马头，回到群岛的中部岛屿。游艇向北行驶会穿越赤道。传统上远航的船只会给第一次穿越赤道的船员举办仪式。像万圣节的庆祝活动一样，船员们穿上奇装异服，一般会有人会扮成海王的模样，在这种仪式中经常有疯狂的举动发生。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>加拉帕戈斯群岛所处的位置也是其物种多样的原因之一。克伦威尔海流（Cromwell Current）又称赤道潜流，只是位于海面以下约100米、从西向东横跨太平洋一道洋流。从北美巴拿马盆地（Panama Basin）和南美洲秘鲁来的寒流与克伦威尔海流正好在位于赤道上的加拉帕戈斯群岛相聚。寒流随着岛屿的地形上升到海面，将大量的微生物带到水面，滋养了群岛附近海域的生物。在有些年份，因为未知的原因，这些寒流变弱，造成海水表面的温度上升，就形成厄尔尼诺现象。</p>

<p>传统需要遵守，当然我们的庆祝仪式要文明的多。船上的所有人都聚集到游艇的驾驶舱，Marco为每个人倒上一杯香槟，我们围在经纬测量仪周围，等待穿越的一刻。当经纬测量仪的上数字跳成零，所有人都爆发出一阵欢呼。庆祝过后，船长还让同船的小男孩自己过了一把开船的瘾。</p>
