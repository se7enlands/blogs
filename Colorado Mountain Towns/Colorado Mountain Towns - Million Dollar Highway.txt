Colorado Mountain Towns - Million Dollar Highway

山城秋色 - 百万美元公路

-----------------
The Million Dollar Highway, with its treacherous terrain and beautiful scenery, is known as one of the most beautiful highways in the United States. When we drove to Silverton, it was raining heavily and there were rocks rolling down the mountain. We had to be super cautious when driving, but the scenery really made the trip worthwhile.

百万美元公路地势险峻，风景优美，被称为是美国最美的公路之一。我们开去Silverton的时候，还下着雨，山上时有碎石滚落。开车时要小心翼翼，但是一路的风景确实让我们觉得不虚此行。

<p>The plan for today was to drive to Silverton and enjoy the fall colors along the way. There was still time to do something around Telluride in the morning. Several of the famous hiking trails do require hours to finish, so I decided to find a trail to run around the area.</p>

<p>The Galloping Goose Trail starts just outside of Telluride, near the fork of Route 145. It follows the San Miguel River, soon turns into the South Fork San Miguel River. While the scenery is not as impressive compared to what I saw on the mountain yesterday, the origin of Galloping Goose has an interesting story to tell.</p>

During the mining boom of the 19th century, there was a railroad connecting Ridgeway, Telluride and Durango. The remains of the station still stands at the point where the San Miguel River meets. In the 1930s, when the mining industry was declining and many related industries were closing down, the RGS company, which operated the railroad, came up with an idea. They replaced some of the freight train with gasoline-powered railcars and turned the railway that transported ore into a tourist route. The name Galloping Goose came from the fact that the cars kept swaying back and forth as they drove through the mountains, and honking sound of their horns.</p>

<p>I took a rest after the run. It was already noon time when we arrived at Dallas Divide. The hillside was colorful but the sun was to bright. It was not a good time for photography. I didn't expect the weather and scenery to be completely different at the same location a few hours later.</p>

<p>We stopped at Ouray to have lunch and looked around those old buildings off the main road. While we were stadning in front of the old courthouse, an older lady was taking pictures next to us. With an excitement on her face, she told us that in the movie "True Grit", this was the door that John Wayne walked out from the courthouse. She must be a big fan of the western movie star. She told us that there is also a bar called True Grit in Ridgway that is worth visiting.</p>

<p>We wanted to have a quick lunch and head to Silverton, but ended up spending a long time waiting for our meal at a cheap Thai restaurant. By the time we left, it was after 2:00 and clouds were gathering in the sky. It looked like the rain was coming. After leaving Ouray, the road started winding up the mountain. By the time we reached the viewpoint of Bear Creak waterfall, the rain was already pouring down. The mountains in the distance were hidden behind the dark cloud, it's raining quite heavily.</p>

<p>The name "Million Dollar Highway" has been given to the stretch of highway 550 between Ouray and Silverton, and some say it is because of the high cost of building the road; others say the dirt used to fill the road contains gold ore and is worth a lot of money. This section of the road is known as one of the most beautiful roads in the United States because of its treacherous terrain and beautiful scenery. Along the "Million Dollar Highway" slowly, one side of the road is high mountains, the other side is no guardrail cliffs. Because of the rain, the road was slippery, and there were stones rolling down the mountain. We probably had the worst weather in the best of seasons, and despite the stunning autumn colors, I didn't dare to be distracted, especially when driving on the outside, I was really nervous.</p>

<p>There are several continuous S-shaped turns in the highway, and the rows of aspen trees on both sides go up the mountain, you really cannot see how unique it is in the photo. There is a small lake called Crystal Lake about a third of the way out, and the hillside from near to far is completely covered with golden aspen trees. It is very imposing even in the misty rain. If the weather is good, it would be nice to have a walk in the mountains.</p>

<p>After crossing the Red Mountain Pass of 11000-feet elevation and taking a big switchback, the road opens up and the rain slowly stopped. After an hour driving, we arrived in Silverton. The small town is located in the valley of Animas River, surrounded by several mountains of nearly 14,000 feets. Highway 550 continues southward, and there are two more high passes to reach Durango.</p>

<p>Silverton's history is similar to Ouray and Telluride in that both started with mining and slowly moved into tourism. Silverton is a bit smaller than the other two cities, perhaps because of the heavy mountainous terrain. For outdoor lovers, it is an ideal starting point for backcountry sports.</p>

<p>We walked along the main street of Silverton and tried to find a cafe or something to warm us up. The time was around 3:30 pm and only some souvenir stores were still open, all the restaurants and cafes were closed. After walking back and forth for a while, we found a restaurant on a side street that was still open. The clerk said there was still some coffee left in the kettle. A cup of hot coffee was enough to cheer us up. Old photos of Silverton and posters of western movies of the 50s and 60s hanging on the wall. It's like walking back to the history standing in the restaurant.</p>

<p>It didn't rain much on the way back, and since I had already done it once, the drive didn't feel so terrifying. At the top of Red Mountain Pass, there is a remnant of a trestle used for mining, from which you can see the magnificent fall colors of the surrounding mountains. The mine ceased operations in 1979, and the reclamation project has been underway since then. The mine has been preserved as part of the local history as well.</p>

<p>It was still cloudy when we were at the Ridgeway, but it gradually cleared up as the road slowly ascended. I wondered if the rain would bring the snow on the mountains. As we were approaching Dallas Divide, I looked into the distance at the San Juan Mountains at the left. There was snow on top! It felt like a dream come true. I stopped the car and took several pictures of the beautiful fall colors with the background of the snowy mountains.</p>

<p>Dallas Divide's parking lot was already crowded with people, tripods lined up along the fence. There is only one photographer standing on top of his car. He had the best location and view point. It was barren dry and hot in the noon and nothing on the mountain tops, a few hours of rain made the mountains covered with snow. The photographer's passion and admiration to the nature is best reflected in this photo.</p>

<p>By the time we got back to the hotel it was after eight o'clock. We looked around the mountain village and couldn't find a restaurant in our liking, so we decided to have dinner at the restaurant in the hotel. We ordered flat bread with different toppings. It turned out that the dish was so huge that can feed at least two more people. The taste was still quite good.</p>

<p>今天的计划是开车去Silverton，沿途欣赏秋色。早晨还有时间在Telluride附近活动一下，几个比较有名的健行路线都需要较长的时间，最终决定就在附近跑一跑。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Galloping Goose Trail的起点位于Telluride城外、145号路的分叉口附近，沿着San Miguel河岸而行，很快转入支流South Fork San Miguel河边。虽然景色和昨天的山路比起来乏善可陈，但是Galloping Goose名字的来历却有一段有趣的故事。十九世纪采矿业火热的时候，这里曾经有一条连接Ridgeway, Telluride和Durango的铁路。在San Miguel河交汇的地方，至今还保留着当年车站的遗迹。二十世纪三十年代，采矿业每况愈下，很多相关产业纷纷倒闭，而经营这条铁路的RGS公司却想出一个主意。他们用烧汽油的汽车代替一部分运货的机车，沿用现成的铁轨，把用于运输矿石的铁路改造成一条观光路线。由于车辆在山间行驶的时候不停地左右摇摆，再加上喇叭的声音酷似鸭子的叫声，Galloping Goose的名字就由此而来。</p>

<p>跑完步休息了一下才出发，到了Dallas Divide的时候已经是中午十二点多。艳阳高照，亮的晃眼，迎面的山坡虽然色彩斑斓，并不是拍照到好时机。想不到几个小时后的同一地点，天气、风景又是完全不同的景象。</p>

<p>我们在Ouray落脚，准备在这里吃午饭，顺便把主路以外的其他老建筑再看一看。当我们在旧法院的建筑前流连的时候，有位美国大妈也在我们旁边拍照。她一脸兴奋地和我们说，在电影《True Grit》里，约翰·韦恩（John Wayne）就是从这扇门里面走出来，崇拜之情溢于言表，估计是这位西部片大明星的超级粉丝。她告诉我们，在Ridgway还有一间叫True Grit的酒吧，值得探访。</p>

<p>我们本来想很快吃顿午饭就赶往Silverton，结果在一家平价的泰国餐馆里等餐就花了好长时间。出发时已经是两点多，天空中乌云堆积，眼看一场雨就要来了。出了Ouray小城，公路开始盘山而上，到了Bear Creak瀑布的观景点，雨已经淅淅沥沥下了起来。远处的山峰笼罩在一片雨幕之中，天空黑蒙蒙的，看来雨势不小。</p>

<p>Ouray和Silverton之间的550号公路有个更响亮的名字，Million Dollar Highway。“百万美元公路”名称的由来说法不一，有人说是因为道路修建费用高昂；有人说填路的沙土中含有金矿，价值不菲。这段路地势险峻，风景优美，被称为是美国最美的公路之一。沿着“百万美元公路”缓缓前行，公路的一侧是高山，另一侧是没有护栏的悬崖。因为下着雨，道路湿滑不说，山上还时有碎石滚落。我们大概是在最好的季节碰上了最坏的天气，尽管秋色迷人，我却丝毫不敢分心，尤其是在外侧行驶的时候，还真有些紧张。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>公路中有几处连续的S型转弯，两侧山石上白杨树一层层沿着山势向上，照片中不能表现其万一。在这段公路大约三分之一的地方有个叫Crystal Lake的小湖，由远至近的山坡完全被金黄色的白杨树覆盖，即使在朦胧的雨幕中仍然气势非凡。如果天气好，应该在山间走上一段。</p>

<p>翻过Red Mountain Pass3358米的高点，再经过一个之字形的大转弯，前面的道路变得开阔起来，雨势也渐渐变小。小心翼翼地开了一个小时，Silverton终于到了。Silverton位于Animas River的河谷间，四周被几座近四千米的群山环抱。550号公路继续向南，还要翻过两个大坡才能到达Durango。</p>

<p>Silverton的历史与Ouray和Telluride相似，都是以矿业起家，慢慢转向旅游业。可能因为重山的阻隔，Silverton比另外两个城市更小些。对于户外爱好者，这里是探险远足的理想出发点。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>我们沿着Silverton的主要街道走过去，逛一逛街景，也想找个咖啡馆什么的，暖暖身子。时间大约是下午三点半左右，只有一些纪念品商店还开着，吃东西的地方都关张了。走了半天，才在一条小街上发现一家餐馆还没关门。店员说还有一些水壶里没卖完的咖啡可以送给我们，一杯热腾腾的咖啡已经让我们很满足了。小店四处都挂着Silverton的老照片和五、六十年代西部电影的剧照，别看外表简陋，还颇有历史感。</p>

<p>回程的路上雨下得不大，因为已经走过一次，开车时也不再觉得那么惊心动魄。在Red Mountain Pass的山顶，有一处采矿使用的栈桥的遗迹，从这里可以看到对面山峦壮丽的秋色。这处矿产于1979年停止运营，此后开始了水源环境的恢复项目。当年的矿山也被保留下来作为当地历史的一部分供人参观。</p>

<p>我们经过Ridgeway的时候还是阴天，随着山路缓缓上升，天气逐渐放晴。我一边开车一边想，这一场雨会不会让山上下雪呢？快到Dallas Divide的时候，我望向远处San Juan群山，山顶上真的有雪！真有一种梦想成真的感觉。我赶忙停下车，拍下这秋色映雪山的美景。</p>

<p>Dallas Divide的停车场已经有很多人，三角架沿着栅栏一字排开，只有一个人特立独行，站着车顶，肆意地拥有最好的位置和角度。想不到中午还是燥热的天气和光秃秃的山顶，几个小时的雨就让群山披上了银装。摄影人面对大自然的崇拜，在这张照片中得到了最好的体现。</p>

<p>回到酒店的时候已经过了八点。我们在度假村转了一圈，没有发现合适的餐馆，于是决定就在酒店楼下的餐馆吃晚饭。我们点了几种不同配料的Flat bread，结果发现量巨大，再加两个人吃也没问题，不过味道还是相当不错的。</p>
