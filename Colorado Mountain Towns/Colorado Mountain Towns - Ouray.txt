Colorado Mountain Towns - Ouray

山城秋色 - Ouray


Like many other mountain towns in Colorado, Ouray has been converted from mining-centric town to a tourists destination. It is a basecamp for the outdoor explorations of the beautiful San Juan Mountains.


像科罗拉多州的许多山中小城一样，Ouray从一百年前以采矿为中心的小镇逐渐成为全年无休的旅游圣地。它是探索美丽的San Juan Mountains的大本营。

<p>The Telluride trip was planned at the same time when we went to Jackson Hole in 2018. Because of the schedule and the pandemic, we didn't got chance to make the trip until this year. Since it was the first time we traveled by air since the pandemic started, we were quite cautious and careful. In Colorado, although almost everyone in the airport and on the plane wore masks, in several local cities, there were few people wearing masks, and the attitude towards pandemic prevention really varies greatly from region to region.</p>

<p>Our flight left California in the morning, connecting in Denver and arriving in Montrose at almost 3 p.m. The view of the Rocky Mountains from the plane was spectacular, but there were not many areas covered with yellow trees. I was a little concerned that we were too early to see the fall colors.</p>

<p>Montrose is about an hour's drive from Telluride. If you don't want to drive yourself, there are shuttles take visitors to Telluride. We got a Chevrolet Equinox, which is an urban SUV, and actually cannot go off-road on the many mountain roads in Colorado.</p>

<p>It was intensely sunny outside. I guess it's almost 80 degrees, and didn't feel like fall at all. We bought some food and water at Walmart and officially set off.</p>

<p>10 more minutes drive after passing Ridgway, we arrived at Ouray. This area was inhabited by the Ute Indian tribe until the arrival of the Europeans. In 1861, with the discovery of gold mines, there was a gradual influx of foreigners. In 1876, the town of Ouray was officially established and named after the chief of the Ute tribe. For nearly 100 years after that, gold and silver mining was the main source of income for the local economy, although there were ups and downs due to the market and regulations. Some mining sites were still in operation even as late as 1990.</p>

<p>Around 1920, the downturn in the mining industry led the residents of Ouray to look for other ways to make a living. Ouray has been called the "Switzerland of America", although it is an exaggeration, the natural beauty of the area made tourism a preferred alternative to mining. To attract tourists, Ouray began building a large public swimming pool in 1923, and to this day, the spa pool is a major tourist attraction in Ouray. Interestingly, when the pool was first built, the town claimed that it was the "most radioactive pool" in the United States. At that time, people thought that radioactivity was good for health, but today, this would scare everyone off.</p>

<p>Most of the existing buildings in Ouray were built in the 1880s to 1890s. We walked around the street, it was almost 6 o'clock, it was a bit late, many stores were already closed, only some souvenir stores and restaurants were still open. We chatted with the owner of a souvenir store for a while, he also loves photography and has a lot of his works for sale hanging on the wall of the store. He told us that the Million Dollar Highway between Ouray and Silverton is a good place to see the fall colors, but the fall in Telluride comes later and the leaves are not yet yellow.</p>

<p>Drive back from Ouray and turn left at Ridgway, we were on our way to Telluride. The elevation rises gradually. Near the top of the mountain, to our left, it's a meadow field extending to the majestic San Juan Mountains in the distance. I stopped to take a few photos on the side of the road and continued on. The place at the top of the mountain is called Dallas Divide, with the San Juan Mountains to the south and the Uncompahgre Plain to the north. It is the watershed between the Uncompahgre and San Miguel rivers. About one mile away from Dallas Divide, there is a viewpoint surrounded by mountains. Especially on the slow slopes of the San Juan Ridge, yellow aspen and red and brown shrubs are intermingled and colorful, with strong autumn colors overflowing. Many people took pictures here and waited for the sunset. I also lingered here for a long time until way after the sunset, before continuing on my way.</p>

<p>After another 40 minutes of driving through the dark valley, we finally arrived at Telluride. We had booked The Auberge Residences for our first night, which are actually private condominiums managed by a company that rents out all sizes of suites. We booked a suit with two roome, but the management couldn't find our order. Eventually, the owner upgraded us to a two-story four-room suite. The room was very new and decorated like a model room, but unfortunately we were only staying for one night.</p>

<p>It was almost nine o'clock. We worried that the restaurant would be closed, so the hotel made sure that an Italian restaurant called Rustico was still open and drove us to the restaurant. The restaurant had both indoor and outdoor seating, and it was still crowded. We ordered a pasta and mushroom lamb carpaccio. The food tasted fine, but the service is awful and the waiter was impatient.</p>

<p>Returned to the hotel, we found that the shower faucet could not be turned off after turned on. We called the apartment plumber, thinking that no one would come because it was too late, but at midnight, the plumber did come. After almost half an hour and tried all sorts of means, the water was finally stopped. Overall, it was a smooth day with some hustles in the end.</p>

<p>Telluride行程是在2018年去Jackson Hole的时候就开始计划了。后来因为时间不合适和疫情的原因，直到今年才又下决心。因为是疫情开始后第一次坐飞机旅行，我们事先很谨慎小心。科罗拉多州果然民风更加彪悍，虽然在机场和飞机上几乎所有人都戴着口罩，但是在当地的几个城市，戴口罩的人寥寥无几，不同地区对防疫的态度果然大不相同。</p>

<p>我们乘坐的飞机早晨从加州出发，在丹佛转机，下午快三点的时候到达Montrose。从飞机上看到落基山脉的崇山峻岭虽然很壮观，但是黄色的树林却是不多。看秋色本来就是碰运气的事情，我有些担心我们来的是不是太早了。</p>

<p>Montrose距Telluride大约一个小时的车程，不想自己开车的话，又公交车往返于两座城市，和适合冬天滑雪的人搭乘。Montrose的机场很小，一进机场就是租车的门面，手续也很快捷。我们拿到的是一辆雪佛兰Equinox，属于都市型SUV，其实不能越野，上不了科州众多的山路。</p>

<p>外面的阳光强烈，估计快30度的气温，实在没有一点儿秋天的感觉。我们在Walmart买了一些食物和水，正式出发。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>经过Ridgway的分叉继续向南，10分钟左右就到了Ouray。在欧洲人到来以前，这一片区域是一直是印第安Ute部落活动居住的地方。1861年，随着金矿的发现，外来人口逐渐涌入。不过因为位置偏远，发展相对缓慢。1876年，Ouray小镇正式成立，以Ute部落酋长的名字命名。在这以后的近一百年间，虽然因为市场和法规的原因有所起伏，金、银矿开采一直是当地主要的经济收入来源。有些采矿点甚至到1990年间还在运营。</p>

<p>1920年左右，采矿业的不景气让Ouray的居民开始寻求其他的生财之道。Ouray被称为“美国的瑞士”，虽然有些夸张，但是优美的自然环境让旅游业成为替代采矿业的首选。为吸引游客，Ouray从1923年起开始修建大型公共游泳池，直到今天，温泉游泳池都是Ouray的一个重要旅游项目。有趣的是，游泳池刚建成的时候，小镇宣称这是美国“放射性最强的游泳池”。当时的人们认为放射性对健康有益，放到今天，怕是整个小镇的人都要被吓跑了。</p>

<p>Ouray现存的建筑大多是1880~1890年代建的。我们沿着街道转了一圈，已经快六点钟，时间有点晚了，好多店铺都已经关门，只有一些纪念品商店和餐馆还开着。我们和一个纪念品店的老板聊了一阵，他也爱好摄影，店里的墙上挂了不少他的作品销售。他告诉我们去Ouray和Silverton之间的Million Dollar Highway是看秋色的好地方，但是Telluride的秋天来的晚一些，叶子还没黄。</p>

<p>开车从Ouray返回开到Ridgway左转，就是去Telluride的方向，一路海拔也逐渐上升。接近山顶的地方向左看去，近处是一片草场，远处是巍峨的San Juan山脉。我停车在路边拍了几张照片又继续向前。山顶的地方叫Dallas Divide，南边是San Juan山脉，北边是Uncompahgre平原，是Uncompahgre河和San Miguel河的分水岭。在距离Dallas Divide一公里左右的地方，有一处观景点为群山环抱。尤其是面对的San Juan山岭的缓坡上，黄色的白杨林和红色、褐色的灌木交相辉映、色彩斑斓，浓浓的秋色满溢。很多人在这里拍照，等待落日。 我也在这里逗留良久，直到晚霞落尽，才继续上路。</p>

<p>在黑暗的山谷里又开了40分钟，我们终于抵达Telluride。我们头一晚订的是The Auberge Residences。这实际上是私人投资购买的公寓房，由专门的公司管理出租，各种大小的套房都有。我们订的大概是两间的套房，结果管理的人却找不到我们的订单记录。经过一番周折，老板给我们升级到了一个四间上下层的套房。房间非常新，装潢如样板房，可惜我们只住一晚，实在有点儿大才小用。</p>

<p>时间已经快九点，怕餐馆打烊，旅馆帮我们确认了一家叫Rustico的意大利餐馆还开门，还开车把我们送到餐馆门口。餐馆有室内和室外的座位，此时还是人声鼎沸。我们点了一份意大利面和蘑菇羊肉片。菜的口味还好，但是服务员态度很差，一副不耐烦的样子。</p>

<p>回到旅馆准备休息，却发现淋浴的水龙头开了关不上，我们可谓是费了洪荒之力，热水还是哗哗的流。我们叫了公寓的水管工，本以为时间太晚，不会有人来，没想到到了12点，水管工居然来了。里里外外忙活了半个小时，终于把水给止住了。一路顺利的第一天，有了个好事多磨的结尾。</p>
