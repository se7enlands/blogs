Colorado Mountain Towns - Telluride

山城秋色 - Telluride


------------

Telluride's gondola is one of the city's highlights. It connects Telluride in the valley with the mountain village at the top of the mountain, offering the possibility of a wide range of activities in the surrounding area. The gondola is the best place to overlook the majestic San Juan mountains and beautiful scenery along its route, and its long running time makes it very convenient for guests visiting both areas.


Telluride的缆车是这座城市的一大亮点。它连接了山谷中的Telluride小城和山顶的滑雪度假村，使两地形成既分离又相互联系的两个区域，为周边丰富多彩的活动提供了可能。缆车沿线视野开阔、风景秀丽，运行时间又长，为在两地游览的旅客提供了很大的方便。

<p>I got up early and planned to go for a run around town first. Although I started running before the COVID-19, I did run longer and longer during the pandemic. I had always been doing the morning walk around town and taking pictures before. Now everywhere we went, I planned in advance where I could run.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Telluride is 8750 feet above sea level, but I didn't feel much uncomfortable during the run. The sun was still just peeking out from behind the mountains, illuminating the tip on the opposite side of the mountains. The aspens on the hillside had turned yellow and were being lit up by the morning sunlight.</p>birch

<p>I ran along the main road of the town. Telluride town is small, I already reached the other side of town a little more than half a mile. The road is lined with stores, galleries and restaurants, and looks much more lively and fashionable than Ouray. Similar to Ouray, Telluride prospered in the second half of the nineteenth century due to the rise of the mining industry and declined as the price of silver fell. It was not until the 1970s that the first ski resort was built and Telluride became an outdoor sports paradise. A variety of cultural and artistic activities follow, and the town regained its former prosperity.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I first turned left and ran to the Telluride Historical Museum, which was the hospital during the mining boom, on the north side of the town, and then ran through town to the San Miguel River.</p>

<p>The San Miguel River originates in the San Juan Mountains that surround Telluride and flows through the town and out of the valley. Telluride is an outdoor sports paradise. In the summer time, the hiking trails crisscrossing the area, and in the winter, ski routes from the top of the mountain run directly into the city.</p>

<p>I ran back to the hotel along the San Miguel River, met up with my wife and headed back to town. We had breakfast at a restaurant called The Butcher & The Baker. The restaurant was recommended by the hotel and was really popular, the waiting line run out the door. Their food were really good and lived up to the reputation.</p>

<p>We only planed to stay in the town for one night and then move to the mountain village. One of Telluride's most famous sights is Bridal Veil Falls. When the snow melts in the spring, the fall, with a vertical drop of over 365 feet, is massive and can be seen from a distance. In the fall, the water volume is much smaller, but we still planed to go there to take a look.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Heading east along the main road that runs through Telluride, about one and half miles out of town, there is a mill. From here, there is a newly constructed trail that leads to the foot of the falls. With an SUV with sufficient horsepower and a high clearance, it is possible to continue on from here, after several switchbacks, to the top of the falls. There is a deserted power station sites there. I stood at the parking lot by the mill and looked at the trail, feeling little confidence in my rental car, so I took a few photos and turned back.</p>

<p>The resort is located on a slope on the south side of Telluride, more than 700 feet above the town. The location of the resort cannot be better, standing on the mountain ridge, one can overlook the magnificent San Juan Mountains and Telluride. The Mountain Village and Telluride are connected by the trails and the gondola, these separated yet interconnected areas offer the possibility of a wide variety of activities around Telluride.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The hotel we booked was the Madeline Hotel, located in the center of the resort. As soon as we arrived at the front desk, the staff handed us drinks and beers. The service was quite good.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the summer timer, Telluride hosts a variety of cultural events and festivals. Sometimes in the town, sometimes on the mountain. When we arrived, there was a classic car and wine festival, as well as an art show. I thought about whether to buy tickets before we left to Telluride. In fact, the art show was held in the central plaza of the resort, right outside the hotel. You probably had to buy a ticket to see the classic cars.</p>

<p>We had our lunch at the hotel's restaurant, Black Iron Kitchen & Bar. Put the taste aside, the dishes looked so beautiful. The ingredients were just a variety of carrots and fruits, with cheese and some purple flower petals sprinkled on top, very colorful and appealing.</p>

<p>The plan for the afternoon was to take the Jud Wiebe Memorial Trail near Telluride. It is on the other side of town. Instead of driving, we backpacked and took the gondola to the town. The gondola that connects the town to the Mountain Village is one of the highlights of Telluride. From the resort, we took the gondola 960 feet up to Station St. Sophia at the top of the mountain, then the gondola continues 1750 feet down to the town at Oak Street. The gondola runs from 6:30 in the morning till midnight. The trip takes only fifteen minutes each way, making it very convenient for guests visiting both places. It is a perfect place to enjoy sunrise and sunset, and the entire trip is free to all visitors, such a visionary decision that locals made!</p>

<p>The Jud Wiebe Memorial Trail is a three-mile trail with 1200 feet elevation gain. The trail starts gently up and it doesn't take long to see the whole town of Telluride. The trail is popular because it is not too long and the views are great. In fact, some sections were quite steep, and we felt a little tired after a short while. After all, we were on the mountain at an altitude of nearly 9000 feet.</p>

<p>We returned to town and checked out a few popular restaurants, only to find that they all need reservations. We eventually chose a small restaurant. Actually, the food tasted pretty good.</p>

<p>早晨起来打算先去城里跑步。虽然跑步是疫情前开始的，但是确实是在疫情中跑得越来越长。每到一个地方都事先计划哪里可以跑，取代了原来早晨去城里走一圈照相的项目。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Telluride的海拔2667米，不过跑步的时候并没有缺氧的感觉。太阳还刚刚从山后露出头，照亮对面山间上的一角。山坡上一片片的白杨树已经变成黄灿灿的颜色，正在被早晨的阳光层层点亮。</p>

<p>我沿着小城的主路跑过去，Telluride的城市不大，不到一公里就已经跑到城的另一头。路两侧是各色的商店、画廊和餐馆，看起来比Ouray要热闹的多，也更加的时尚。与Ouray相似，Telluride在十九世纪后半叶因为矿业的兴起而繁荣，又随着银价的下跌而衰落。直到1970年代，第一个滑雪度假村建成，Telluride不但成为户外运动的天堂，各种文化艺术活动也随之而来，小镇又恢复了往日的兴旺。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>我先左拐跑到Telluride北侧山脚下的历史博物馆，这是当年矿业繁荣时期的医院；又穿过小镇，跑到San Miguel河边。</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>San Miguel河发源于环抱在Telluride周围的San Juan山脉中，穿过小镇，流出山谷。河水一侧的山坡上已是满眼金黄，除了白杨树，各式高矮灌木也都换上秋装。Telluride真是户外运动的圣地，除了有纵横交错的远足路线，在山脚下就能看到由山顶而下的开阔路线，到了冬天，那就是滑雪的雪道，由山顶直达城中。</p>

<p>我沿着San Miguel河边的小路跑回旅馆，和领导回合，又回到城中，这一次可以边走边逛。我们在一家叫The Butcher &amp; The Baker的餐馆吃了早餐。这家餐馆是旅馆推荐的，果然很受欢迎，队伍一直排到了门外，端上来的餐点也确实没有让我们失望。</p>

<p>我们只计划在城中住一晚，今天会搬到山顶的滑雪度假村（Mountain Village）。Telluride最著名的景观之一是新娘面纱瀑布（Bridal Veil Falls）。春天积雪融化的时候，瀑布水量充沛，垂直落差一百多米，远远就可以看到。秋天的时候水量就小很多，不过我们还是打算过去看看。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>沿着贯穿Telluride的主路一直向东，出了城大约两公里，有一个磨坊。在这里下车，有一条步行小路可以到达瀑布脚下，据说十分崎岖。如果有马力足、底盘高的SUV，从这里还可以继续向前，经过一段反复的之字型山路，开到瀑布的顶端，上面还有一个当年的发电站遗址。我站在磨坊边的停车点，看了看继续上行的山路，自觉对租来的车没有什么信心。上路上有不少大大小小的碎石，正常开上去也许没问题，就怕碰到困难的路段没办法处理。想想只得作罢，照了几张照片就掉头回去。</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>向西穿过小城，大约十五分钟就到达山顶的滑雪度假村。度假村位于Telluride南侧山脉上的缓坡上，比小城高出两百多米。它的选址真是精妙，站在度假村山边的一侧，不但可以远眺壮丽的San Juan山脉，还可以俯瞰Telluride小城。度假村和Telluride有山路和缆车相连，形成既分离又相互联系的两个区域，为Telluride周边丰富多样的活动提供了可能。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>我们订的旅馆是位于度假村中心的Madeline Hotel。一到前台，工作人员就为我们递上饮料，服务相当到位。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>夏秋两季，Telluride会举办各式各样的文化艺术节。有时在山上、有时在山下，几乎每个星期都有。我们到的时候正在举办老爷车和葡萄酒节，同时还有艺术展。我在出发前还考虑了是否要事先买票。其实艺术展就在度假村的中心广场上举行，出了旅馆大门就是，大概参观老爷车是要买票的。</p>

<p>午饭就在旅馆里的餐馆（Black Iron Kitchen &amp; Bar）解决。菜品的味道倒在其次，颜值是非常在线。食材不过是各式胡萝卜和水果，加上芝士、再撒上些紫色花瓣，五颜六色的十分养眼。</p>

<p>下午的计划是走Telluride附近的Jud Wiebe Memorial Trail。这条路线在小城的另一侧，这一次我们不开车，而是背上包、做缆车到城里，再从城里出发。连接小城和滑雪度假村的缆车是Telluride的一大亮点。从度假村出发先乘缆车上行300米到达山顶的中转站（Station St. Sophia），翻山的乘客不用下车，缆车继续下行530米，到达Telluride位于Oak Street的终点。Telluride和山顶之间这一段路线长、高差大，全程都可以远眺San Juan群山、俯瞰Telluride。冬天时山坡上是白雪中挺拔的树林，现在则是满溢的秋色，而在这或浓烈、或萧瑟的山峦之间，静卧着的是Telluride小城。缆车六点半开始运行，一直延续到午夜，单程不过十五分钟，对在两地游览的客人非常方便，也是欣赏日出、日落的绝佳地点。不仅如此，这条线路还是全程免费，不得不佩服当地政府和居民的远见。</p>

<p>从Aspen街向山里走，过了一座小桥就是Jud Wiebe Memorial Trail。这是一条大约五公里长的山路，攀升大约370米。开始的路段缓缓上行，走不多久就可以看到Telluride小镇的全貌。山路不长、风景又好，我想这是很多人喜欢这条路线的原因。实际上有些路段还是颇为陡峭，我们走了不久，就感觉有点累了，终究这是在海拔接近三千米的山上。</p>
