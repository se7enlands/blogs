Known for its beautiful scenery and winding roads, Last Dollar Road is highly recommended as a top choice for enjoying the fall colors. With the help from the stormy weather, I was very lucky to capture a few shots I am happy with.

Last Dollar Road是一条从Telluride出发，穿越San Juan山脉，到达Dallas Divide的山路。以风景优美、道路曲折著称，是Telluride一带欣赏秋色的首选。幸好天公作美，有云雨配合，我拍了几张还算满意的片子。

<p>Today's plan is to do a hiking in the morning, starting from Mountain Village, taking the Ridge Trail up to San Sophia Station, the highest point of the gondola; then take the Village Trail back down to the resort. The total distance is about 7 miles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The trail starts at the gondola station, but the beginning of the trail is not very well marked and is mixed up with several downhill trails. It took me a few times to find the way I wanted to go. The Ridge Trail is quite steep, mostly 10 to 15 degrees uphill. The trail starts with some switchbacks, and then it goes up along the mountain ridge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I started at 8:00 a.m. and the sun was still behind the San Juan Mountains. The trail runs through the aspen forests. I could see Telluride and the mountains across the town only occasionally, most of time, the view was blocked by the forest. The route up the mountain was a little more than 2 miles, and it took me about an hour to reach the top. The sunlight started reaching the tip of the mountain and lighting up the slope, and the color of the aspen leaves were getting brighter.</p>

<p>At the top of the mountain is the transfer station of the gondola, San Sophia Station, from where many people take the gondola to the top and either descend or go further to other hiking trails. Finally there is an open view, with the Mountain Village on the slopes below, and the distant mountain range with Sunshine Mountain and Wilson Peak to the west.</p>

<p>The Village Trail descends slowly, except for some sections of gravel or loose dirt, and is very easy to follow. There is a straight and gentle slope somewhere in the middle, and you can see the mountain range across the Telluride and San Miguel River valleys, several of which are 14ers. The aspen extends to halfway up the mountain. This is the most epic scenery on the trail, even if you are in a hurry, you have to take a break here and take a deep breath, all the hardships of the trek are rewarded at this moment.</p>

<p>Back to the hotel and we went for lunch. We chose a restaurant called Altezza. It is in the hotel of The Peak Resort, which is located on the outskirts of the Mountain Village. The restaurant had a good rating and when we arrived we found that the view was even better. Sitting on the patio, we could see the golf course by the hotel, the mountains in the distance, the colorful autumn colors from golden to orange to crimson, and the meal was quite delicious.</p>

<p>Last Dollar Road is a mountain road that starts from Telluride, crosses the San Juan Mountains, and reaches Dallas Divide. Known for its beautiful scenery and winding roads, this road cannot be considered tough for expert off-roaders, but it is impossible to drive the entire length without the right vehicle. Around Telluride, this road is highly recommended as a top choice for enjoying the fall colors. We planed to drive and see how far we could go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The road starts at the roundabout of Route 145 outside of Telluride, from where it turns up the hill. Before reaching the airport, T60 forks to the right and becomes a dirt road. As the terrain rises, the views open up. Not too far into the trail, I stopped at the Deep Creek trailhead and took this photo. I was very happy with this photo, from the change in color to the layering of the aspen forest.</p>

<p>The road continued up the mountainside. Clouds gathered in the sky and suddenly it started to rain. it always seems to rain in the afternoon in the San Juan Mountains, and the stormy sky is a perfect match for the autumn colors. What impressed me the most was the color and texture of the cascading trees on the rising hillside, but there weren't many places to stop on the roadside, so I couldn't find the right spot to capture the ideal shots.</p>

<p>After reaching a open flat area, Last Dollar Road made a 90-degree turn to the right and the road became even steeper. I gave up my intention to continue up the road. The mountains lined up in the distance, separated by river valleys. The sun shone through the tumbling clouds on the rows of golden aspens. A few vehicles campped here, it is perfect place to enjoy the magnificent scenery.</p>

<p>There is a trail off Last Dollar Road that leads through the aspen trees. Carrying my tripod, I walked deeper into the woods along the path and was surrounded by silence. The aspens are strong and lush, with bright yellow leaves and snowy white trunks, making this a great trail for meditating alone or walking with a loved one.</p>

<p>On the way back, instead of returning directly to the resort, we continued driving south along Route 145. This way forward greeted the majestic mountains and the bright fall colors were a sight to behold. We stopped at a small lake called Cushman Lake on the side of the road. It was drizzling a bit, but it didn't affect the mirror-like reflection of the aspens and mountains.</p>

<p>Back at the hotel, we took the gondola to Telluride again for dinner. We had booked the place the day before and the address is the name of the restaurant, 221 South Oak. This is one of the best restaurants in Tulluride, we ordered Lamb chops and Bison short rib, which were quite good.</p>

<p>今天的计划是早晨先徒步爬山，从Mountain Village出发，走Ridge Trail爬升到缆车的最高点San Sophia Station；然后再走Village Trail下山回到度假村。全程大约11公里。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>山路的起点就是缆车车站，开始的一段标记的不是很清楚，和下山的自行车道混在一起。我仔细看着地图，还是反复了几次才找到想走的路。基本上是向着山脊的方向，就不会错太多。Ridge Trail的山路比较陡，大多是10到15度的上坡。先是一段之字型的山路，然后就是沿着山脊一直向上。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>我早晨八点出发，太阳还被San Juan山脉挡在后面。小路在白桦林中穿行，有松树林间或其中，视线被阻，即便是沿着山脊的一段，也只能偶尔看到对面的山峦或是Telluride小镇，没有什么开阔的视野。上山的路线大约3.5公里，我一边走一边照相，花了一个小时多一点才到山顶。阳光渐渐从山尖洒满整个山坡，黄色的白桦树叶也变得更加明亮通透。</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>山顶是缆车的中转站，San Sophia Station，有不少人乘缆车到山顶，再从这里下山或去更远的徒步路线。山顶的视野非常开阔，可以看到下面山坡上的Mountain Village，还有西边Sunshine Mountain和Wilson Peak一带的远山。</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Village Trail一路下行，坡度很缓，除了有些路段有碎石或是松软的土路，都很好走。中间有一段笔直的缓坡，一路可以看到对面Telluride和San Miguel河谷对面的崇山峻岭，好几座都是4000米以上的高山。白桦树林一直延申到半山腰，既有大片的金黄，也还有不少碧绿的颜色。这是这一路上最壮丽的景致，就算再急着赶路，也要在这里歇一歇脚，深深吸一口气，所有跋涉的艰辛都在这一刻得到了回报。</p>

<p>回到酒店和领导回合去吃午饭。我们选的是一家叫Altezza的餐馆，在The Peak Resort的酒店里，位置算是度假村的外围。餐馆的评分不错，到了之后才发现风景更是绝佳。坐在室外的露台上，酒店边的高尔夫球场、远方的群山、从金黄到橘红直到深红色的缤纷秋色尽收眼底，再加上餐点也相当可口，虽然隔壁桌发生了点儿事故（加热炉的顶盖掉了下来，幸好没有人受伤），我们还是尽兴而归。</p>

<p>Last Dollar Road是一条从Telluride出发，穿越San Juan山脉，到达Dallas Divide的山路。以风景优美、道路曲折著称，对驾车越野的高手来说，这条路不能算艰难，但如果没有合适的车辆也很难全程通过。在Telluride周边，这条路被一致推荐为欣赏秋色的首选。我们打算开车看看能走多远。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>道路的起点是Telluride城外145号路的分叉口，从这里转上山，在到达机场以前T60向右分叉，变成进山的土路。随着地势的升高，视野也变得开阔起来。行不多远，在Deep Creek的步道起点，我停车拍下了这张照片。从颜色的变化到白桦林的层次感，我对这张照片都很满意。</p>

<p>道路继续在山腰上前行。天空中乌云聚集，忽然间下起雨来。San Juan的山间似乎总要在下午下一场雨，风起云涌的天空是秋色的最佳搭配。我趁着雨骤雨驻的间隙拍了几张照片。其实给我印象最深的是拔地而起的山坡上，层层叠叠的树林的颜色和质感，但是路边停车的地方不多，无法找到合适的位置抓到理想的取景。</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>行至一块略微开阔的平地，Last Dollar Road向右做了个90度的转弯，道路变得更加陡峭。我放弃了继续向上的打算，在空地上停了下来。远处的群山依次展开，与之相隔的是一道道的河谷。太阳穿过翻卷的云层，照在山间的一排金黄的白桦树上。大自然的美景总是可遇而不可求，有几辆车辆在此露营，倒是可以随时欣赏这风云变幻。</p>

<p>Last Dollar Road旁边有一条小路，穿过白桦林，可以走到Summit Lake湖边。我扛着三脚架，沿着小路向树林深处走去，转眼就被一片静谧包围。白桦林长得粗壮茂盛，婆娑明黄的树叶、雪白挺拔的树干，这是一条适合独自冥想或与爱人携手漫步的小路。</p>

<p>回来的路上，我们没有直接返回度假村，而是沿着145号路继续向南开。这一路向前迎着巍峨的群山，亮眼的秋色让人目不暇接。我们在路边叫Cushman Lake的小湖停下来。天有点儿下着小雨，但不影响如镜的湖水倒影的树林和山峰。</p>

<p>回到酒店，我们再次乘缆车到Telluride吃晚饭。地方是昨天就订好了的，地址就是餐馆的名字，221 South Oak。这是Tulluride最好的餐馆之一，我们点的主菜是羊排和Bison Short Rib，滋味相当不错。</p>
